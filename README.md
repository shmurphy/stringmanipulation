# stringmanipulation
Project for a Date Structures course to learn string manipulation. Simulates a genetic algorithm, where a string is randomly created and "evolved" to make a desired string. The algorithm chooses two "best fit" strings to merge together into a string that is closer to the desired string. The process repeats until the string has been manipulated to become the desired string.
